🧓💰 Hy-Bieda Simulator — Civilized ZUS Pension Calculator
Purpose

Hy-Bieda Simulator is a web-based retirement simulator designed to make pension forecasting transparent, human-friendly, and accessible to everyone — not just those comfortable with spreadsheets or financial jargon.

It reimagines the current ZUS calculator in a more citizen-friendly form, assuming that base government data (like income history, contribution periods, etc.) would be seamlessly available to the user.
For now, this data is mocked — but the vision is a “zero-input” experience, where anyone (even a grandma) can log in and instantly see what the government already predicts for their future pension.

Key Features

🧾 Mock ZUS Profiles: Users can explore realistic pension projections using demo profiles (e.g., Jan Kowalski, Anna Nowak).

🧍‍♂️ Minimal User Input: The tool auto-fills all available data from mock ZUS systems. Additional inputs (like desired retirement age or target pension) are optional, not required.

💡 Citizen-Friendly Design: Clean colors inspired by ZUS branding, reworked into a calmer, more readable palette for comfortable daily use.

📊 Pension Projection Engine: Calculates projected capital, estimated monthly pension, and replacement rate using user and mock ZUS data.

📈 Visual Clarity: Interactive charts show future pension growth over the next 5 years — including comparison with minimum, average, and maximum pensions to illustrate realism of user expectations.

🤖 AI-Enhanced Forecasting: A fine-tuned LLM model analyzes demographic and economic variables to refine projections and generate personalized investment suggestions.

💼 Investment Insights: Suggests real-world options (ETF Index Funds, Real Estate, Crypto Assets, etc.) with predicted returns, risk levels, and time horizons. Future versions will use live economic data for accuracy.

📥 Report Download: Users can export personalized pension snapshots — including charts and financial parameters — as PDF or XLSX reports.

🔍 Transparency: Users can toggle “Mock ZUS data” to see the source assumptions behind their projections.
